                                                             *octopress-intro*
vim-octopress provides syntax support for Octopress posts (in Markdown or
Textile formats) and provides some Octopress rake tasks to run within Vim.

You can always find the latest code on GitHub:

https://github.com/tangledhelix/vim-octopress

                       *g:octopress_default_format* *octopress-default-format*
By default, Octopress will assume a file's base syntax is Markdown, unless:

  - The filename ends in .textile, which will switch to Textile mode
  - The buffer is unnamed and 'g:octopress_default_format' is 'textile'

Example:

    let g:octopress_default_format = 'textile'

The default format is 'markdown' unless otherwise specified.

                                                           *octopress-textile*
Though the default format is Markdown, Textile is supported as well. You
must install the Textile bundle yourself, since it is not included with
Vim (at least not as of version 7.3). You can get the Textile bundle at
either of the following locations:

    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2305

    https://github.com/timcharper/textile.vim

                                                           *octopress-autocmd*
To use this mode for your Octopress files, use an autocmd.

    autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.markdown,*.textile set filetype=octopress

Since Octopress is a superset of Markdown and Textile, it should not interfere
with non-Octopress Markdown and Textile files. It's also a superset of the
Jekyll syntax, so it should work fine for any pure Jekyll files you might have.

                                                                  *:Octopress*
The :Octopress command

:Octopress <task>

<task> is one of:

    generate     Regenerate output files from sources
    deploy       Default deploy task
    gen_deploy   Generate and then deploy
    push         Deploy to GitHub Pages
    rsync        Deploy via rsync
    clean        Clean caches (pygments, gist, sass)

                                                 *g:octopress_rake_executable*
By default, 'rake' is taken from your path. If you want to use a different
rake, specify its path in 'g:octopress_rake_executable'.

    let g:octopress_rake_executable = '/path/to/rake'
